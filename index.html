      	<h2><strong>Coastal Management of the Beach 🏖️</strong></h2>
          <p>
          Coastal zones occupy less than 15% of the Earth's land area, while they host more than 45% of the world population. Nearly 1.4 billion people live within 100 km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level, with an average density 3 times higher than the global average for population. With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, human activities originating from this small land area will impose heavy pressure on coasts. Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and industrial activities. Protection against rising sea levels in the 21st century is crucial, as sea level rise accelerates. Changes in sea level damage beaches and coastal systems are expected to rise at an increasing rate, causing coastal sediments to be disturbed by tidal energy.

          <h2><strong>Ecoplage 🌴👙</strong></h2>
          <p>
          ECOPLAGE answers the issues related to beach protection, beach development and promotion. Whether you have beach creation projects, site enhancement or stabilization of the shoreline projects, the company shares its expertise to provide support and advice you on various options remaining environmentally friendly. This process is part of a dynamic and resilient coastal management approach. ECOPLAGE also holds two patented technologies : Ecoplage which is a drainage system that consists in placing drains under the beach, parallel to the coastline and linked to a pump station. The drainage dries the foreshore, slows erosion and helps maintain the beach.                  Enerplage is a system which uses the highly filtered water produced by the drainage system to produce energy. This is the principle of seawater heat transfer (use of the sea heating capacity) to generate heat or cold for the infrastructures located near the beach.
